          <b><i>Scott Joplin (1867-1917)</i></b> was an American composer and
          pianist, often referred to as the "King of Ragtime." Born in
          Texarkana, Texas, Joplin came from a musical family and displayed an
          early talent for the piano. He received formal music training and
          later worked as a traveling musician. Joplin is best known for his
          contributions to the ragtime genre, a style of music that gained
          popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous
          composition, "Maple Leaf Rag," was published in 1899 and became a
          major success, earning him widespread recognition. Beyond his popular
          rags, Joplin composed other works, including operas and ballets,
          showcasing his desire to elevate ragtime to a more sophisticated form
          of art. Despite facing financial challenges and personal hardships,
          Joplin's impact on American music endured, and he left a lasting
          legacy as a pioneering figure in the development of ragtime,
          influencing future generations of musicians. Scott Joplin died in
          1917, but his music continues to be celebrated for its innovation and
          cultural significance.

          <b><i>Jelly Roll Morton</i></b> born Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe on
          October 20, 1890, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a pioneering American
          jazz pianist, bandleader, and composer. Widely recognized as one of
          the key figures in the development of jazz music, Morton played a
          crucial role in the transition from early jazz to the more organized
          and sophisticated forms that emerged in the 1920s. Morton claimed to
          have invented jazz, coining the term "jazz" to describe the music he
          played, although this assertion has been debated by music historians.
          He began his musical career playing piano in the bordellos of
          Storyville, New Orleans' red-light district, and later performed in
          vaudeville shows and with various bands. In the 1920s, Morton made a
          series of groundbreaking recordings with his Red Hot Peppers,
          showcasing his distinctive piano style and compositions. Some of his
          notable compositions include "Black Bottom Stomp" and "Jelly Roll
          Blues." Morton's music combined elements of ragtime, blues, and the
          emerging jazz styles of the time. Despite his significant
          contributions to jazz, Morton's career declined in the 1930s, and he
          struggled financially. He spent his later years in relative obscurity,
          working odd jobs and occasionally performing. Jelly Roll Morton passed
          away on July 10, 1941, in Los Angeles, California. His legacy lives on
          as a pivotal figure in the early development of jazz, and his
          recordings continue to be influential in the world of music.

          <b><i>Bill Evans (1929â€“1980)</i></b> was an influential American jazz
          pianist and composer, renowned for his lyrical and emotive playing
          style. Born on August 16, 1929, in Plainfield, New Jersey, as William
          John Evans, he began his musical journey at an early age, studying
          classical piano before transitioning to jazz. Evans gained prominence
          in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a member of the Miles Davis

          acclaim for his innovative approach to jazz, incorporating unusual
